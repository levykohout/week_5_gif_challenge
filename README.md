# Weekend 5 Challenge

In this challenge, we refactor the API Giphy code previously made and added more features to expand our knowledge in Angular, Angular routes,controller and services, server-side logic, SQL and Bootstrap.

## Features

In this application, users will be able to

- Get a random Giphy or search for a Giphy by keyword.
- Save their favorite gifs along with a note about why they like that gif.
- Quickly add gifs from a list of gifs from the search result.
- Quickly see count how many items in the favorite list.
- View a list of their favorite gifs.
- Update their comment on a given favorite gif.
- Delete a favorite gif. The count display needs to reflect this!
